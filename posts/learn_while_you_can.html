        I have a philosophy, learn things while you can, because when you struggle, you will be at someones mercy.
      </p>

        I have seen a lot of people say to me that I will learn this one day, but could you help me today with this. Most often then not I have some time and I tend to help them with whatever they need help with.

        I am from very young age was inclined towards technology and now I am working in the same field. When I started applying for jobs a lot of people saw my resume and told me they would also like to make their resume stand out. My resume was nothing special. I have learnt my way around Latex while writing my thesis and found some very elegant looking resumes hence I made one for myself.

        My brother and my sister too saw my resume and asked me one for them, which I did happily but then I started to see the downside of it, I started getting more requests from them, could you please edit this and could you please add this so on and so forth. I complied to these requests whenever I could but it became a problem quickly. I asked both of them to have a 1 hour meeting with me so that I could teach them these basic things about the resume so that they don’t need to call me and ask me for help and to my surprise they said we don’t need this very often and so long you are with us, we don’t need to worry about this. I was said and frustrated to hear this. My brother soon realized this because he had to edit a few things and I was busy and he took the meeting the same day.

        My wife has the same problem, she is enrolled in online classes and more often than not, for small tasks of generating a pdf or writing and adding attachments on email from phone she comes to me for help and I explain to her how to do it but she takes it for granted.

        This attitude is also seen in the tech industry. This is not just one of problem of people resisting to adapt to new tech or learning about them but this is about adapting and learning new technology when the old ones become inefficient. This kind of barrier is often comes in disguise, where people who are experienced does not want to let go of the tech stack because they are too familiar with it.

        In the above cases my wife, my sister and my brother all were at my mercy, if I had said that I have nothing to do with their resume anymore, they would have had to resort to making their resumes from very beginning in Word or some other website.

        To all these folks I want to say one thing. Learn the things while you are not struggling with it, for what you don’t know when you will struggle for the same thing you have been avoiding to learn.
